                                 On the date of

                           The 12th of March of 2024

                                CANTUS CYGNEUS

   in general, by Agora, and by the integrity of this office, I put forth this

                                   WRIT OF
                                FUNGIDAE AGORAE
                           GRANDISSIMA EXPROBRATIONE

                   thusly commanding that e be deregistered.

                            The CANTUS CYGNEUS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

being a player is too complicated. too many taxes, rules, confusion, etc.
look at all these complex cfj's on the existence of rules, whether
fundamental agoran components have worked
like the full process for a proposal to be adopted has 5 BASIC steps, which
are all broken down even further into many additional sublevels (submit a
proposal, distribute it, vote on it, resolve it, it takes effect), and then
parallel to those 5 steps are various rules that intercept them, providing
prohibitions and alterations,
and still some of those basic steps are being called into question on their
efficacy,
so we're having to sift through history back to 2011? 2014? when???, before
I was even a player, to fix it, and I didn't even agree or know of the
whatever rules that I was supposed to be playing by this whole time
and it feels like we're all fighting against the ruleset to fix it, when we
are the ones in control the whole time
this is also like the same thing when we had to ban madrid: it takes too
long to do a simple thing!

also I'm just bad at being a player:
i ran a tournament and it took 6 months or something to finally get
assigned a judge (i made it too complicated, and I should not have been
involved in it itself, so I could thereby judge it.)
and I had no chance of winning the tournament anyways even if I got the
most wins within it, (which I probably didn't anyways), because I wanted to
be silly
and I haven't really gotten that close to winning in my registered time
otherwise (which are required for the ultraviolet/platinum ribbons)
and I haven't really had much success with a lime ribbon, nor indigo, at
all.
and I forgot to award myself a violet ribbon when I became a marvy
my "long service" patent title for geologist is at risk. that and I haven't
even been doing those reports.

i'd like to come back as a player... but only when things are less
platonic, so maybe I can understand what's going on better, or at the very
least, my opinion will matter more. I refuse to continue to agree to a
ruleset that I can never, ever, know the real text of with 100% certainty.
By looking too closely at a ruleset causes it to change is quantum
bullshit. that should at least be explicitly mentioned somewhere, anywhere.
but not even that. it was presented as fact, and now we can CoE it all the
way to 2011. Or whatever. this is not a game I thought I was playing at
all, and it's a symptom of platonicity. it's ethically wrong to allow
people to agree to a contract and then find that they actually agreed to a
different one, so whether I agreed to the old one, or I agreed to a new one
there are many less players playing, I don't know, but the rug has been
thoroughly pulled from under me. even if it's "fixed" it's not fixed to me,
because it's still based on some unknowable, platonic ideal, so this
problem is fully capable of just occurring again when player inevitably
lapse in their maintenance of gamestate and scrutiny, or perhaps we just
missed an important component crucial to actually fixing the problem at
hand.

also generally these past rulesets looked like they were having fun doing
funny funky silly things, doesn't seem much silliness abounds at the
moment. it's just so... pedantic right now. i thought it would just be
silly little ideas that we bat around and then put out of their misery,
like Mao or 1kbwc.

instead it feels like a game of pedantic historical accuracy and repairs.
why does it need to be repaired so thoroughly? just play the game like what

So if/when I come back as a player, hopefully I'll know 100% which game I'm
playing, or at least, there will be something worth playing.
