I deny this claim.

blob is a current player. Or, rather, ?blob? is the name of a
current player. As we have established this last week, a name is a name
if people are willing to use it. If the original blob were to come back,
we'd have to resolve this situation ? but crucially, this is informal.

As to the monthly report, where the two players appear in the same
context, I'll find a way to disambiguate it. For actions and reports in
the current context, we all know (and all shall know when looking upon
the archives) to which blob this refers. And, if someone publishes any
ambiguous reference to a ?blob?, that that's just that: ambiguous.
