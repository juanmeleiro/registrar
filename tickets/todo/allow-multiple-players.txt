# Allow multiple players where applicable

Allow for user to specify multiple players in commands where that is
applicable. Specifically:

- register
- deregister
- activate
- deactivate

The git message will list all of them in the title if the length is
short enough. Otherwise, it will display “<action> some players”
and specify eir names in the commit message body.
