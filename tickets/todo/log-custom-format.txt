# Custom format for the log

Design and implement a custom format for the log. Maybe something
like this:

```
<timestamp> <action> <arguments>
```

For example:

```
1696883312	register	Some Player	email@example.com	message://some-long-uuid.message
```

Note the use of tabs. This would avoid the problem where the Lua library
that deals with JSON just scrambles it up each and every time. That, and
it also avoids adding new dependencies (e.g., `jq` for pretty-printing
and sorting the JSON files).
